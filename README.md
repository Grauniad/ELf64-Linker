Overview 
========

Linkers and Loaders (John Levine, see: http://www.iecc.com/linker/ ) provides an interesting introduction to linkers and proposes a project to build your own linker. Sadly the online code and object files are not complete. 

This project has two parts

1. A python implementation of the linker that reads LINK files, links them and writes a new LINK file. The implementation passes the examples for which data exists at http://www.iecc.com/linker/
2. A C++ library that can read in ELF64 libraries (targeting linux x86-64) and writes LINK files. It will also be able to read in a valid LINK file and create a valid ELF binary

Using these components it will be possible to link basic binaries. Note however that the LINK format is just a teaching tool, and is hopelessly in-efficient. Once the implementation completes the book, the C++ library will be enhanced to do the linking itself.

Current State (May 2013)
==========================
The python linker can handle symbol resolution, allocate memory sections and build the out file.

The library can handle object files generated by gcc create valid LINK files. Current work is on re-building a new OBJECT file from components.
